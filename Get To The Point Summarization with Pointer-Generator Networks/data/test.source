Raising my head , I see the moon so bright ; withdrawing my eyes , my nostalgia comes around .
All are past and gone ; we look to this age for truly great men .
The friendship between men of virtue is light like water , yet affectionate .
The friendship between men without virtue is sweet like wine .
Cherish not the gold-threaded gown ; Cherish instead the days while you are young .
